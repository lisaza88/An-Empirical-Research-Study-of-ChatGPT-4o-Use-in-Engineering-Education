# An-Empirical-Research-Study-of-ChatGPT-4o-Use-in-Engineering-Education
AI Interaction and Writing Metrics Pipeline
This repository contains the full data processing pipeline, metric computation scripts, and interface code used in a study examining AI (ChatGPT-4o) prompting behaviors and writing performance among engineering students.

Structure
The codebase is divided into logical modules that reflect the complete workflow:

1. Interface
Interface Python Code: A GUI tool used by students to interact with ChatGPT-4o. Prompts and responses are logged with timestamps, course, session, and activity type. Logs are automatically emailed to the researcher on session close.

2. Data Merging
parse_ai_logs: Parses raw .txt files to extract prompts/responses, remove near-duplicates, and compile block-formatted logs.

convert_assignments: Converts .docx student submissions to .json format with cleaned text.

convert_grades: Converts Excel grade sheet to structured JSON.

merge all data: Merges prompt logs, AI responses, assignments, and grades into a unified dataset.

3. Writing Quality Metrics
SC - compute_structural_complexity: Calculates sentence-level grammatical and syntactic complexity.

CR - compute_content_richness: Computes lexical diversity and content density.

4. AI Interaction Metrics
ARR - compute_text_similarity

ARR - compute_copy_paste_score

ARR - compute_structural_similarity

ARR - compute_prompt_response_consistency

ARR - compute_query_submission_link

ARR - compute_ai_response_reliance: Combines all five sub-scores into final ARR score.

QD - compute_lexical_structure

QD - compute_multistep_depth

QD - compute_focus_clarity

QD - compute_query_depth: Aggregates all three components into QD score.

QE - compute_query_efficiency: Computes QD-to-query ratio.

PRD - compute_prompt_refinement_depth: Measures semantic and structural prompt improvements.

RU - compute_semantic_novelty

RU - compute_conceptual_transformation

RU - compute_contribution_final

RU - compute_response_utility: Combines all into final utility score.

PS - compute_stepwise_alignment

PS - compute_conceptual_application

PS - compute_independent_expansion

PS - compute_problem_solving_score: Combines all three into final PS score.

5. Final Output
Final Dataset - final_export_to_excel: Combines all fields and metrics into a structured .xlsx file for statistical analysis.

Dependencies
Python 3.8+

pandas, openpyxl, docx, Levenshtein, spacy, nltk, scikit-learn, sentence-transformers, tqdm, smtplib

Notes
The code was designed to process over 900 AI-access sessions and 1800+ written assignments.

Metric columns are populated with zeros if students were absent or didnâ€™t have AI access.

All logs and metrics are aligned per student ID, session number, and course type.
